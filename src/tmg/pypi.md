I wrote a Python package to analyze TMG measurements!

You can find it at [tmg.ejmastnak.com](https://tmg.ejmastnak.com).

It is used to analyze TMG time series.

It can perform TMG parameter computation, rate of force development analysis of TMG measurements, and SPM-based analysis.

It is used in [TMG Toolkit](tmgtoolkit.com)!

It was used to perform the statical analyses in [this published article on SPM](#) (TODO)

## Motivation, use case

It is used to detect and quantify potentiation.
We are interested in potentiation at a research level and for improving athletic performance.

A phenomenon in which a short, intense burst of muscle activity (called a conditioning exercise in this context) temporarily increases the amplitude, force, and speed of both voluntary and electrically induced muscle contractions that immediately follow.

## Motivation for understanding potentiation

In general, prior muscle activity produces two different—and potentially coexistent—muscle responses: fatigue and potentiation.
Limited by the inevitable onset of fatigue, one cannot use conditioning exercises to increase subsequent muscle performance via potentiation ad infinitum—eventually fatigue outweighs any potentiation-like performance improvement.
Fatigue can coexist with PAP (Rassier and MacIntosh, 2000), and measured muscular performance represents the net balance between processes that cause fatigue and processes that cause potentiation (Rassier and MacIntosh, 2000).
Striking a favorable balance between fatigue and potentiation should be of interest to coaches, sports scientists, and athletes alike.
Doing so requires a reliable means of detecting and quantifying potentiation, and statistical parametric mapping (SPM) offers a novel way of doing so—directly in the time domain in which the muscle response is originally measured.
